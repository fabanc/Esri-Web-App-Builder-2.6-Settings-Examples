# Esri Web App Builder 2.6 Settings Examples

## Overview

This project aims to provide simple examples on how to crete setting pages to make web app builder widgets easily configurable. The different examples show how to use different configuration options. So far the examples include:

* Setting CheckBox: an example to make a boolean variable configurable using a check box.
* Settings Color: an example to make a color configurable throught the setting pages.
* Settings List: an example to make a variable configurable throught the setting pages using a selection list.
* Settings Number: an example to make a numeric variable configurable throught the setting pages.
* Settings Radio: an example to make a variable configurable using radio buttons throught the setting pages.
* Settings Text: an example to make a text variable configurable throught the setting pages.


## Code contributions

Code contributions are welcomed! A few things to keep in mind when doing an example:

* Chose one parameter that you want to expose via the settings page, and only one.
* Make sure that the configurable variable is displayed in the widget. It does not need to be pretty, just show that the settings page is actually modifying that variable.
* Test, test, test. From configuring the widget to using it in an app, make sure it works. There is nothing more frustrating than an buggy example.

Happy coding.
